<h2>About me</h2>
<br/>
<p>Hello, my name is Sead Silajdzic and I am 22 years old. I am working as a web developer. Currently, I am trying to expand my knowledge with new technologies such as C# and JavaScript. While creating websites I am using Laravel, MySql, Bootstrap and CSS. In my opinion, my advantage is a great will for the learning of the new technologies, working with others and working until I am fully satisfied with the product. Also, the greatest part of my free time I am spending converting my ideas to websites.</p>

<h2>About project</h2>
<br/>
<p>This project is my current portfolio and in the nearest future, it will be updated with new projects redesigns etc. When I get to the point where my code is repeating too much I will upgrade this project to laravel and make it dynamic. So stay tuned if you are interested in how it will look like.</p>
